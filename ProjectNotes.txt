For a financial services professional, a GitHub portfolio needs to strike a balance between **clean software engineering** (how you write code) and **domain expertise** (how you interpret data).

Since you don't have hosting but want interactive elements, I highly recommend using **Streamlit**. It allows you to build a web app entirely in Python, and **Streamlit Community Cloud** will host it for free directly from your GitHub repo.

Here are two project suggestions tailored to your background:

---

## Project 1: The "Smart Beta" Portfolio Optimizer

**Goal:** An interactive dashboard where a user inputs a list of tickers, and the app calculates the "Optimal" weights based on different financial theories (e.g., Minimum Volatility vs. Maximum Sharpe).

* **Public Data Source:** `yfinance` (Yahoo Finance API).
* **Interactivity:** A sidebar where users can type in tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA), select a date range, and choose a risk-free rate.
* **Key Financial Concepts to Show:**
* **Efficient Frontier:** Plotting the risk-return trade-off.
* **Sharpe Ratio:** Calculating excess return per unit of risk:


* **Correlation Matrix:** Visualizing how the chosen assets move together (essential for diversification).


* **Skills Demonstrated:** Optimization libraries (`PyPortfolioOpt` or `scipy.optimize`), data visualization (`Plotly`), and API handling.

## Project 2: Equity Factor Attribution & Regime Analysis

**Goal:** A project that takes a specific stock or portfolio and breaks down how much of its return is driven by "Factors" (Value, Momentum, Quality, Size) vs. the broad market.

* **Public Data Source:** **Fama-French Data Library** (available via `pandas_datareader`) or **FRED** (Federal Reserve Economic Data).
* **The Logic:** You aren't just looking at price; you are performing a linear regression to see if a stock's outperformance is just "luck" or a specific "style" exposure.
* **Key Skills to Show:**
* **Linear Regression:** Using `statsmodels` to run multi-factor models.
* **Rolling Regressions:** Showing how a stock’s sensitivity to the market (Beta) changes over time.
* **Regime Detection:** Using a simple moving average crossover or volatility threshold to label "Market Regimes" (Bull vs. Bear).


* **Hiring Manager "Hook":** This shows you understand the *mechanics* of equity returns, not just how to plot a line chart.

## How to showcase this without "Traditional Hosting"

Since you want these to be available to hiring managers, here is the professional "Portfolio Stack":

1. **GitHub Repository:** Structure it with a `README.md` that includes screenshots or a GIF of the app in action.
2. **Streamlit Community Cloud:** (Free) Connect your GitHub repo to Streamlit. It will give you a public URL (e.g., `your-project.streamlit.app`). You can put this link at the very top of your Resume and GitHub profile.
3. **Binder or GitHub Codespaces:** If you prefer keeping it as a Jupyter Notebook, you can add a "Launch Binder" button to your README.
 This allows a hiring manager to click a button and run your code in their browser without installing anything.

### A Professional Tip for Financial Repos

Hiring managers in finance look for **Unit Tests** and **Error Handling**. 
Don't just write a script that works; write a script that doesn't crash if the API returns a `None` value or if the user types in a fake ticker like "CASH-IS-KING." 
Use `try-except` blocks and include a `requirements.txt` file.
